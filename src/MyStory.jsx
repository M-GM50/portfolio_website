          <p>My adventure with coding started in 2019.</p>
          <p>
            I was having the time of my life in Qu√©bec when the pandemic hit and
            put me of out a job.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used that time off to try and learn something new. My partner is a
            developer and he introduced me to this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got <span id="hooked">hooked</span>.

            The pandemic showed no sign of stopping so switching career became
            more and more obvious for me.
          </p>
          <p>I started going to various tech events.</p>
          <p>
            I first one was{" "}
            <a href="https://www.offf.barcelona/">OFF Barcelona 2023</a> where I
            was able to learn more about the tech world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also went to <a href="https://reactnorway.com/">React Norway</a>{" "}
            in Larvik.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I joined a Software Engineering Bootcamp. It was a decisive
            turn. It was happening.
